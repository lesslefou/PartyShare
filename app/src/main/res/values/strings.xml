He must say three words that are written in his book - all the innocents have the same three words they MUST use, but the murderer has three different words.

    <string name="galerapagosGameInfo">After their boat sank, a group of survivors found themselves on a deserted island. The setting is paradisaical but life is difficult. The water flows with the meager rainfall and the fish are made to eat.. rare. It\'s not certain that everyone survives this regime.. The only solution: build a large raft together. But we must not delay long because the clouds on the horizon indicate the imminent arrival of a dangerous hurricane. At the end of the game, the player(s) who manages to leave the island at time wins, unless no one survived, of course!</string>

    <string name="sixQuiPrendGame" translatable="false">6 Qui Prend</string>
    <string name="sixQuiPrendGameInfo">In "6 qui prend"!, a.k.a. Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible. To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that\'s below the card\'s number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.</string>

    <string name="unoGame" translatable="false">Uno</string>
    <string name="unoGameInfo">Uno\'s goal is to get rid of all his cards. To win, you will have to score 500 points or vice versa, i.e. be the one with the least points when one of the players exceeds 500 points.</string>
